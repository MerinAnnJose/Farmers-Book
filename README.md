## What is the project?
This was the project for my first ever hackathon. It is a forum for farmers to get connected with each other and also to get to know more about their produce and soil types and post their queries. 

## How was it made?
It has a very simple UI which is easy to understand and is available in the local language. Th backend is done completely using flask.
